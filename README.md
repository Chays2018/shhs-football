This website is for our highschool football team so that they can navigate and have a source of information to fall back on. With any website you come across your average problem to deal with as usual. For our website it's this paragragh that we call the cursed paragragh. But we later figured out that we didn't ctrl s to save the file of code so now it works as itended. We had different people work on different files for instense all three of us worked on the home page and I myself worked on the sponsor page and helped a little with the others. My other group mates worked on the other parts of the website. So, that sums up everything to do with our website and its origin.
